If you would like to update your fork with all the branches and tages
from upstream, use:

  ./updatebranchestags.sh <upstream-remote> <target-remote>

where upstream-remote would normally bu this repo, and target-remote
would be your fork's origin.

If you want to update just the master branch of your fork
from this upstream or a particular branch, follow these
instructions:
